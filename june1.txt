python :high level interpreted lamguage
interpreter and compiler are used to process high level to low level
interpreter: it does what the program sayes
compiler: it reads the program and translate completely before the program startrunning.
interpreter can be use in two ways
 1.interactive mode: type the python programs and interpreter dispays the result
 2.script mode:store the code in file,interpreter executes the contents of that  file {python script end with .py}
program:sequence of instruction that specifies how to perform the computation
basic instructions:input,output,condition execution,math,repetition
program error:bugs
error correcting:debugging
types of error:
1.syntax error:It is due to the incorrection in structure of the program and 
also about the structure.
2.runtime error
3.semantic error
Debugging:programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what we want
programming language:formal language that have been designed to express the computation
syntax rules come in 2 flavors
a).Tokens
b).structure of the statement
parsing:ability to figure out what the structure of sentence
